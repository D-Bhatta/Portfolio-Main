## Open Source Contributions

### [scikit-image: Image processing in Python](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4599)

- Illustrated usage for natural sort algorithm by processing documentation in PR, which was successfully merged into master branch.

## Free Lancing Work Experience

### Recent Client: Cr*****U (Startup): Fintech Android App [Name withheld for client confidentiality]

- Designed and developed Java Android app with respect to client business requirements.
- Developed **authentication, data storage,** and certain business **functionality using API calls** for said app.
- Developed and deployed **serverless Amazon Web Services** backend with **Amplify, DynamoDB, API Gateway, S3, and Lambda**.

**Technologies used: Java, Android SDK and Google APIs, AWS Amplify, AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3, AWS Lambda**

## Key Projects—See Portfolio at [portfolio.debabrata.xyz](https://portfolio.debabrata.xyz/)

Key projects showcasing Full Stack projects, Python projects, standalone Android apps, etc.

## Full Stack Projects

### Diabetes Prediction

*Full Stack **Android app** with a **Flask backend** that performs diabetes prediction with an **ensemble of 6 trained machine learning models**.*

- Designed application architecture from specification documents, which was used to develop detailed Agile based plan for project development.
- Led a team of 4 developers to create user interfaces and **Kotlin** code, and delivered functionality on a tight deadline.
- Developed **pipelined architecture for training and serializing 6 models** on the Pima Indians diabetes data set, which were then **encapsulated into an ensemble**, and **deployed a Flask application** to act as an **API** and serve as the backend for the Android app

**Technologies used: Kotlin, Python, Flask, scikit-learn, Android SDK, Pytest**

### Random Question Paper Generator

*​**Web** and **Android app** with a custom **python backend service** that generates custom Question sets from a very large question bank database.*

- Led a team of 8 developers to design and develop a **PHP** web application component and a **Kotlin Android** component.
- Developed a **Python** application queries a **MariaDB** instance with 1000s of questions and generates a well-balanced question paper in **3 seconds**.
- Optimized the python application and the database instance that **reduced processing time** by 12 seconds **from 15 to 3 seconds**, a reduction of 500%.
- Ported the web app to an Android app, which enabled app use on mobile devices.

**Technologies used: Python, Kotlin, PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, MariaDB, Android SDK, Pytest**

## Python Projects

The next few sections detail Django, Flask, and Standalone Python projects.

### Django Projects

#### Nasa-Get

*​**Django app** that displays data collected from querying **NASA APIs**.*

View here: [Deployed on PythonAnywhere.](https://d5625.pythonanywhere.com/home/).

- Designed the app to be a no code solution to viewing latest data from NASA's public APIs.
- Simple design for a clean UX.
- Smart, auto-expiring authentication for security.
- Supports up to 4 NASA APIs.

**Technologies used: Python, Django, NASA APIs, Ridge CSS, HTML, SQLite**

#### OpenCV-Masker

*​**Computer Vision Django app** that utilizes the OpenCV-Masker algorithm to mask colors in a video.*

View here: [Deployed on PythonAnywhere.](https://dymmy1forgames.pythonanywhere.com/masker/home/)

- The app can **render objects** of a certain color **practically invisible** in an entire video.
- Allows user to remove a color in a video and replace it with the background.
- Replicates the invisible cloak effect in Harry Potter movies.

**Technologies used: Python, Django, OpenCV, Ridge CSS, HTML**

<!-- ### Django-Invoicing

- Developed an invoicing Django app with a PostgreSQL backend for daily use by freelancers
- Developed and deployed native authentication functionality using usernames and passwords
- Created a solution for customising the invoice page from app settings itself
- Developed functionality to download a PDF version of the invoice
- Automated generation of invoice number, dates, etc.

**Technologies used: Python, Django, Ridge CSS, PostgreSQL, pandoc** -->

### Standalone Python projects

#### Project-Setup

*​**Python** application that sets up a custom development environment in seconds.*

- Created functionality to store any commands in **YAML** files, which created a layer of abstraction that allows for language agnostic setup.
- Wrote tests for the entire package leading to more than 95% code coverage using **pytest**.
- Developed and documented set of commands for setting up python projects along with CI pipeline using Travis-CI, which leads to consistent local workflow across all projects of the organization.

**Technologies used: Python, YAML, Pytest**

#### Wget Downloader

*​**Python** utility that downloads and archives webpages using the wget tool.*

- Designed application architecture to generate layers of abstraction so that only a file with links is required for input, simplifying archival operations.
- Downloads and stores webpages within individual folders.

**Technologies used: Python, Wget**

## Machine Learning with Python Projects

### Machine Learning Projects

- Developed models for the following datasets: **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, Boston Housing dataset, Iris flowers dataset**.
- Analyzed the **StackOverflow 2019 developer survey**.

## Android Projects

### Echo Music Player

- Developed music player Android application using **Kotlin**.
- App can play, stop, resume music files stored on the device.
- Automatically discovers music files on device.
- Can 'favorite' music with a `Favorite` button.

**Technologies used: Kotlin**
