## Full Stack Projects: Diabetes Prediction

*Full Stack **Android app** with a **Flask backend** that performs diabetes prediction with an **ensemble of 6 trained machine learning models**.*

- Designed application architecture from specification documents, which was used to develop detailed Agile based plan for project development.
- Led a team of 4 developers to create user interfaces and **Kotlin** code, and delivered functionality on a tight deadline.
- Developed **pipelined architecture for training and serializing 6 models** on the Pima Indians diabetes data set, which were then **encapsulated into an ensemble**, and **deployed a Flask application** to act as an **API** and serve as the backend for the Android app.

**Technologies used: Kotlin, Python, Flask, scikit-learn, Android SDK, Pytest**
